Create a `config.js` file in the root of your project folder, and add the following code:

```js title="config.js"
let { APS_CLIENT_ID, APS_CLIENT_SECRET, APS_BUCKET, PORT } = process.env;
if (!APS_CLIENT_ID || !APS_CLIENT_SECRET) {
    console.warn('Missing some of the environment variables.');
    process.exit(1);
}
APS_BUCKET = APS_BUCKET || `${APS_CLIENT_ID.toLowerCase()}-basic-app`;
PORT = PORT || 8080;

module.exports = {
    APS_CLIENT_ID,
    APS_CLIENT_SECRET,
    APS_BUCKET,
    PORT
};
```

We simply read the environment variables from `process.env`, and exit the application
immediately if any of the required properties are missing. And if no bucket name is provided,
we generate one by appending the `-basic-app` suffix to our application Client ID.

:::caution
Note that the Data Management service requires bucket names to be **globally unique**,
and attempts to create a bucket with an already used name will fail with `409 Conflict`.
See the [documentation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-POST)
for more details.

Now, to pass actual configuration values to our application for debugging purposes, we need to create
a [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
Use _Run > Add Configuration_ in the menu to create a new configuration, and when prompted
for the specific environment, choose _Node.js_. This will create a new `.vscode`
subfolder in your project with a `launch.json` file where you can define different
launch configurations. Replace the content of the file with the following:

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Server",
            "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "start"
            ],
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**/*.js"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

We are defining a single launch configuration called _Launch Server_ that will start
our application (using the `npm start` command), and what is more important, it will
look for a `.env` file in the project folder, and provide any `<key>="<value>"` pairs
defined in this file as environment variables to our application. Let's create
the `.env` file in the project folder, and populate it with our environment variables
(using your own values instead of the placeholders of course):

``` title=".env"
APS_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
APS_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
APS_BUCKET="optional-name-of-existing-bucket"
```

:::caution
Since the `.env` file contains sensitive information, make sure that it is **not** included in git!
This can be ensured by adding the `.env` line to the [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file.
